Find the 10 most anomalous days

For those days, analyze the minute-level data looking for anomalous behavior in the several days leading up to that day.

Separately, find the 10 most anomalous hours and 10 most anomalous minutes. See if those times coincide with the 10-most anomalous days.

Look for possible explanations of whether the times we uncover actually match up with unsual activity in the bitcoin world.
